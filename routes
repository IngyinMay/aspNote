Routing
- Conventional routing typically used with controllers and views.
- Attribute routing used with REST APIs. 


Conventional Routing
- in program.cs
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    
- /Products/Details/5 model binds the value of id = 5 to set the id parameter to 5. See Model Binding for more details.

- {controller=Home} defines Home as the default controller.

- {action=Index} defines Index as the default action.

- The ? character in {id?} defines id as optional.

- Default and optional route parameters don't need to be present in the URL path for a match. See Route Template Reference for a detailed description of route template syntax.
- Matches the URL path /.

- Produces the route values { controller = Home, action = Index }.
